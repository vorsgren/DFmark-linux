TO BACK UP SAVES:

(1) Copy the relevant region folder in "data/save" to a safe location.
(2) When you want to reuse it, copy that region back to "data/save".  Do *NOT* overwrite an old folder, as it might leave residual files.

Please *DO* back up saves.  Although the game has permanent death and you might want to play it in that spirit, the game
is also an alpha, and your world might become corrupted by an error.  You can also make use of the auto save features settable in "data/init/init.txt".



TO USE OLD SAVES WHEN UPDATING VERSIONS:

(0) ***Note that this version of DF is only compatible with saves from 0.40.03+.***
(1) Unzip the new dwarves into a *NEW* folder.
(2) Copy "data/save" from the old folder into the new folder, or copy over the relevant region folders you've saved to "data/save".  Keep a backup in case something is wrong with the new version.
(3) When you start, your world should be accessible and ready to play.

Unzipping the new dwarves into your old folder will work most of the time, but if files have changed, it can crash, or worse yet, destroy your saves.



TO CHANGE DISPLAY AND SOUND OPTIONS:

Go to "data/init/init.txt".  These options will take effect the next time you start the game.



IF YOUR KEYBOARD ISN'T WORKING:

If you can get to the ESC keybindings menu (from the start screen, press ESC and then 2/8 to scroll to Key Bindings), you can set your key bindings.  If your "?" key on your keyboard doesn't work for help, you can set the keybinding properly here.  It might not display as a "*".  You can set the display up properly in "data/init/interface.txt" using the display strings at the top of the file.

Release notes for 0.44.12 (July 7, 2018):

Just some cleaning before we embark on the villain changes.  There's a new offloading popup that can come up on the season change if you have enough activity in your world; it can take a little time in larger worlds, but that's all time that is no longer intermittent lag and it's also less time overall due to reduced redundancies.  If you have an autosave, the offload will be incorporated into that, so autosaves might seem slightly longer (if so, you are also getting the same lag reduction.)

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed crash from corrupted units
	(*) Made baron elevate to count properly
	(*) Removed intermittent lag from off-site conceptions and births (added seasonal unit offloading)
	(*) Made squad orders respect successful site conquest (so new members don't try to reconquer)

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Fixed broken display for multiple adventurer agreements
	(*) Show proper mission text for messengers instead of No Job
	(*) Made tantruming dwarves cancel activities
	(*) Controlled how market links are formed somewhat

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.11 (June 23, 2018):

There are now peaceful and not-so-peaceful ways of expanding your influence in the world.  Once a site becomes linked to you (through prosperity or by conquest; you'll see a message), you can send a messenger there to request workers, or send dwarves from the fort out to such sites (from v-p).  This only works on historical figures, so you might find you don't have off-site workers available at first, though some sites do have them.  This release should also improve the issues dwarves were having with negative thoughts, and they can also now experience permanent changes in their personalities and intellectual values due to events in their lives.

Note: Insurrections were such a problem in sites that I had to turn them off for your fortress's holdings; we'll get back to that later.  It wasn't even the insurrections, really; the dwarves were bailing on the occupation immediately because they were afraid of insurrections.

New stuff
	(*) Your civilization will send out groups to found sites near prosperous fortresses
	(*) Existing sites near prosperous fortresses will associate themselves to those fortresses
	(*) Added ability to take over sites and install administrators
	(*) Can view your new holdings from the 'c' screen
	(*) Can send workers off-site and send out messengers to request their return
	(*) Mulling over long-term memories can lead to shifts in intellectual values and personality changes

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed hauling route crash
	(*) Fixed problem causing county stage to be skipped in noble elevation
	(*) Stopped all visiting barons from being elevated along with your baron
	(*) Changed horror calculation from seeing a dead body
	(*) Stopped similar memories close in time from taking all the memory space
	(*) Stopped stuttering lag from repeated vegetation connectivity checks

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Camping refugees will be awake during the day now

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.10 (May 5, 2018):

Here's our next effort, which should change the general situation regarding the (often inebriated) fortress dwarves and their lack of apparent stress.  Part of this involves a new system of memories, which we'll be improving as we go now.  You'll be able to see these in thought paragraphs as they are remembered, so don't worry if they aren't apparent at first.  There were also other problems with inebriation and overall stress balance; some of the latter will be ongoing, if we've overcorrected, as varied long-term forts are difficult to test, but we'll continue working with it.

I've updated how the adventurer information log works.  It's hopefully a bit more useful for navigation now, when it comes to adventuring and reporting back what has happened.  Old saves might not have everything linked up at first.  Hearing rumors again and so forth should make the log start to work better for them.  You can also cross narrow rivers in travel now (the ones that are jumpable or near jumpable at a sprint.)  Uncrossable rivers will display with double lines in the travel view.

New stuff
	(*) Made short and long term memories of emotions and their circumstances

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed crash relating to religion trying to store holy relic without a temple
	(*) Stopped inebriation personality alterations from being permanent

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Balanced stress effects
	(*) Allowed nicknaming of all buildings/zones/stockpiles
	(*) Can now zoom to item and unit for item inaccessible announcements
	(*) Added dwarf-style personality and other information in adventurer description from status screen
	(*) Updated adventurer log screen
	(*) Allowed adventurer to cross over narrow rivers in travel map
	(*) Shows status of single assigned workers in q/t workshop menus
	(*) Separated thoughts for seeing somebody die and finding the body
	(*) Changed how drunken fistfights work
	(*) Side-stepped unit load failure, creating substitute unit upon irreversible corruption
	(*) Added check for duplicate items from returning squads and others to avoid crashes/corruption

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.09 (April 1, 2018):

And the linux freeze fix process broke projectiles.  So that's hopefully all working all around now.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Made projectiles and weapon traps work again

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Changed w.g. population calculation for conflicts

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.08 (March 28, 2018):

This should stop Linux from freezing.  It also includes some other bug fixes that could be quickly incorporated.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Stopped linux from freezing
	(*) Fixed crash from demanding tribute from parentless site entities
	(*) Stopped artifacts from moving out of backpack and similar when at old forts or lairs
	(*) Properly stopped imprisoned dwarves from claiming positions in fort

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Made dwarves visit museums properly
	(*) Stopped every tribute rejection from being attached to your fort's history
	(*) Cleaned tribute/spoil reports between forts properly
	(*) Added military tactics and leaderships as relevant skills for squad-leading nobles/appointments
	(*) Made uniform settings copy properly when pasting schedule orders

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.07 (March 12, 2018):

This is a stability patch for the last release.  A few raid-related crashes are fixed, as well as some strange behavior related to stolen livestock.  To get the full fix for stolen livestock, old saves will need to add [PET] to beak dogs and unicorns.  This isn't crucial; if it isn't done, those animals will no longer be stolen in that save.  But if you were experiencing the bug, the existing animals will be broken until the tag is added.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed crash from returning certain kinds of contained loot
	(*) Fixed crash from exploring entity-free site
	(*) Stopped certain failed tribute raids from staying out forever
	(*) Stopped certain stolen livestock from being treated like half-citizens

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Fixed sieger behavior that caused them to mill around outside for too long
	(*) Stopped stolen livestock from being attacked after they are named
	(*) Fixed failure to give half of the one-time tribute items
	(*) Allowed military tactics as starting skill choice on embark
	(*) Corrected one-time tribute text
	(*) Made it produce a proper spoils report if only livestock are stolen

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.06 (March 9, 2018):

Here's the first substantial update to the fortress's world map screen.  New raid options are available, and it shouldn't be hard for you to antagonize your neighbors now if that's what you want to do.  Use the 'd'etails option when preparing the raid to set what sorts of actions you'd like your raiders to perform.  Skills and equipment matter, and skills can be improved during missions.  The skill of your best tactician is important (you'll see feedback in the mission report.)  If you demand tribute on an ongoing basis and the target site agrees to your demands, you'll receive something like a merchant caravan on an annual basis a few seasons after the initial demand.  They'll drop goods off at your depot and depart.  These goods can be carried off immediately for storage, but there's a new report so you can look at a complete list of what was delivered; the same is true of spoils from raids.

A few notes on the bug fixes below:  the identity fixes won't stop bad feelings from existing conflicts in old saves.  Also in old saves, distracted animals might still appear to be broken at first, but they should sort themselves out after a bit.

New stuff
	(*) Can pillage and raze and demand tribute from other sites
	(*) Dwarves on missions can now can gain skills
	(*) Military tactics skill is now gained and matters in off-site battles

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed several problems causing the meeting queue to get gummed up
	(*) Made monster-type critters and non-monster-type critters have proper hostile again
	(*) Allowed people in the same squad to know each other's identities
	(*) Made scribe copy job cancel properly to free up materials
	(*) Fixed calculation of available writing materials in library

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Various speed tweaks
	(*) Made clean job work inside and on outdoor constructions
	(*) Made clean jobs continue to nearby tiles
	(*) Made drunkenness make you less private instead of more private and fixed a typo there
	(*) Made dwarven adventurers experience trances properly
	(*) Made non-historical populations defend sites post w.g.
	(*) Made off-site raid stealth success depend on site
	(*) Fixed broken flags on merchant historical event
	(*) Stopped dwarves being dragged to cages/chains from trying to clean the floor
	(*) Stopped live generals from being elevated from zombie populations
	(*) Stopped animals from developing need for alcohol after experiencing trauma
	(*) Stopped unintelligent creatures associated to civilizations, like domestic animals, from worshipping gods when given historical status
	(*) Stopped animals from revealing the location of artifacts to questers
	(*) Stopped animals from forming grudges and other chat-based relationships
	(*) Sped up legends loading in high-artifact worlds
	(*) Stopped rooting around in the dirt from resetting path
	(*) Fixed issue causing certain older army units from not appearing
	(*) Fixed a few errors with abstract skill calculation for armies
	(*) Reconciled bandit's map and in-play valuations of opponent strength to stop aborted ambushes
	(*) Disallowed certain flying/swimming/visual/projectile/attack moves involving half-stairways
	(*) Made branches/twigs burning over walls leave behind a floor properly


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.05 (January 14, 2018):

One fix on top of the last release, for visitors that had become broken, acting like partial residents.  Any broken visitors themselves are unpatchable in affected saves, so it was important to get this one up quickly.  Old saves are compatible as usual, and should not get new broken visitors, but visitors that are currently acting strange will still be acting strange, and likely will not depart.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Stopped certain visitors from being treated like (buggy) residents

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.04 (January 10, 2018):

This is another bug fix release to start the new year.  A few of the bad five-second freeze/lag problems caused by the new release have been fixed, and large beasts should move off the edge of the map again.  Over in adventure mode, inappropriate creatures shouldn't yell 'identify yourself' and companions should participate in conflicts as they used to, and some other issues of reputation should be solved, especially among citizens of the starting town.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Stopped displayed artifacts from duplicating on retirement/offloading of site
	(*) Made attacking giant monsters path to targets properly again
	(*) Stopped extraneous dwarf mode conversation text generation (freezes)
	(*) Stopped negative artifact location rumors from passing around so much (freezes)
	(*) Made removing first stop of hauling route w/ assigned vehicle not cause issues/crashes
	(*) Stopped crash caused by yielding to muggers
	(*) Stopped creatures from asking for identity when they shouldn't be able to speak
	(*) Fixed problem with companions and other close people not always recognizing your relationship to them

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Made returning mercenaries stop petitioning for sanctuary (existing petitions will still be there)
	(*) Prevented unirrigated etc. top-left corners etc. from stopping planting in farms
	(*) Stopped inaccessible pile tiles from stopping bin/barrel placement throughout pile
	(*) Allowed stairs to be carved in ice that is one tile above stone properly
	(*) Added building item TSK indicator to ground items as well
	(*) Stopped designations for removal of ramps/constructions from working on hidden tiles
	(*) Removed incorrect back instruction from burrow naming
	(*) Properly saved freeing hf in relevant historical event (Quietust)
	(*) Fixed a few cases of historical event for identities reporting wrong historical figure
	(*) Fixed kitchen job hotkeys

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.03 (December 25, 2017):

Here are some bug fixes to close out the year.  Notably, visitors shouldn't arrive in such large numbers so early on, and fewer of them should overstay their welcome (in old saves, people already in transit will arrive, but it should taper off.)  Adventure mode commanders etc. should recognize more of your accomplishments properly and not talk about unknown creatures so much, but identities have introduced some non-trivial issues there that we'll have to build through more carefully, and there'll be some ongoing silliness.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed crash from guide agreements
	(*) Fixed crash related to off-loaded items coming into play
	(*) Made agents and roaming questers respect visitor cap
	(*) Fixed problem causing agents not to check fort for tavern
	(*) Made fort-visiting questers leave properly
	(*) Made fort claim certain looted artifacts properly instead of leaving them on edge of map
	(*) Fixed several cases of "unknown creature" utterances
	(*) Fixed problem with neighbors not recognizing you, including commander and other quest givers
	(*) Stopped undisplayed items from lingering on display furniture
	(*) Made dwarven off-site squads stranded during preparation return to the fort
	(*) Made 32-bit Mac version recognize new keys

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Fixed broken plant indicator on food stockpile
	(*) Made opinion monologues on performances etc. show text properly
	(*) Made log show completed kill orders properly

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.02 (November 23, 2017):

Hopefully this'll stop the problems we've been having in world generation!

Linux Update: I should be able to test the Linux drive on Saturday once I get the hard drive enclosure, and we'll go from there.  Apologies for the continuing delay.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed world gen crash associated to agents checking on site government after it collapses

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Stopped returning pet dogs from petitioning for sanctuary like rescued prisoners
	(*) Stopped uncontested raids reports from starting at year 0

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.44.01 (November 22, 2017):

This is the artifact release, featuring the ability to send your dwarves off to cause trouble in the world, improved kobold sites, cover identities, artifact questers, and a bit of artifact diplomacy.

In fort mode, the 'c' screen which used to list civilizations still does that as a suboption, but its main purpose now is to show the world map and allow you to interact with it.  You can either raid a neighbor generally, or send off squads to recover specific artifacts or rescue particular people (in which case, the squads will still bring back other artifacts and prisoners, but focus on the goal.)  A squad questing after an artifact will seek out information if the first site doesn't work out, and this might take several months, so be prepared.  Squads can also be captured during raids, though typically someone will return to tell the tale.  When squads return, a report will become available; a yellow 'R' will appear over on the left margin, and pressing 'r' will let you see it.  Sometimes reports are quite lengthy as squads stumble from tavern to tavern; you can press enter to skip to the end of the path animation.

There are some rough edges here!  Be sure not to send off your commander if you are planning to reorganize your military, as they are the only one with the power to assign new squads and cannot do so while off the map.  There was a last-minute hiccup with artifacts known to be held by people (rather than stored on sites); these fort-mode missions will be fruitless for the moment; the most common instance here is books authored by people that then hang on to them, so don't try to steal their books!  It says on the map screen when an artifact is held by somebody, so it should be easy to avoid.  Raids do not bring back non-artifacts or build skills; these issues may or may not be addressed in the short-term depending on difficulties that arise.

The interactions with heroes and invading armies are more straightforward.  There will either be 'P'etitions or a diplomacy popup to handle.

In adventure mode, you can assume a cover identity.  You do this from the 'k' conversation menu (if you are already talking to somebody, it'll be hidden in "start new conversation".)  If you choose to link your identity to a civilization, you'll be carrying that baggage with you, especially when you are being interrogated by goblin guards, so one should be prudent.  To turn off the identity, go back to the "assume an identity" menu and choose the 'x' "no identity" option.  You can also reuse existing identities from this menu.

People in adventure mode that are seeking an artifact will list "missing treasure" among their troubles, and you can then inquire further.

In order to name an object, use 'I' to interact with it, and it'll be one of the options for appropriate objects.  For example, you can give a name to your spear or waterskin, but not to the water or food you start with.

There are also various adventure rough edges.  For instance, if you pick up and then immediately replace a museum piece in adventure mode, and then tell somebody about it, you'll get credit as a Treasure Hunter.  It'll be difficult to fix that without additional property information, etc.  It's also generally hard right now to find artifact quests, as most things are in their proper place and/or not subject to an outside claim.  We'll be working with this a bit as we generally work on stabilizing the release.

Overall, many of the changes occurred under the hood, in preparation for the myth and magic release, but now the magic release will be able to incorporate artifacts of all kinds without additional delay, so hopefully it was time well spent.

As usual, your old saves should work, but please back them up before diving into the new release!  It is quite likely that forts will fall into technical ruin as bugs come up and are handled at this early stage.  Old forts won't have object additions like the pedestals and display cases, but they should be able to send out raids from the 'c' screen.

We will be focusing on the worst bugs (crashes etc.) at first, and then we'll broaden out into other bugs, old and new, and minor suggestions/usability improvements, as well as a general smoothing out of the new features.  We're still working on the design side of the first magic release, so we anticipate we'll be doing smaller releases for a while.

New stuff
	(*) Ability to send out squads to raid sites, rescuing prisoners and recovering artifacts
	(*) Display cases and pedestals, museum zones, both in forts and other sites
	(*) Can view the world map w/ rumors from fort mode
	(*) Artifacts created during worldgen: dwarf moods, named heroic objects, holy relics, heirlooms
	(*) New artifact events in play and worldgen: questers seek artifacts and ask for or steal them, invaders demand artifacts
	(*) New historical events associated to the creation of artifacts (used in fort and worldgen)
	(*) Agents used by civilizations to gather information, can assume cover identities
	(*) Improved kobold site maps
	(*) Goblin site denizens demand an identity instead of immediately attacking every stranger
	(*) More modding control over pets and other animals
	(*) Adventurer can assume a cover identity at will
	(*) Adventurer can name their possessions
	(*) New adventurer reputations related to artifacts
	(*) New religious activity: monks, pilgrims and prophets
	(*) Museums and other room types can be added to fort locations like taverns and libraries
	(*) Various additional data in the XML export

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed weapon trap crash vs. item breakage
	(*) Fixed bug preventing monster slayers from visiting those forts with monsters to slay
	(*) Made animated skulls, hair and other bits easier to pulp
	(*) Made idle and vermin-hunting dwarves come down from trees more successfully
	(*) Made thirst/hunger and being pushed out of the way less likely to terminate dances

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Alphabetized broad stock screen categories

	(*) Made simple burrow beasts start in caves as possible

	(*) Took age into account for w.g. fights vs. body size (e.g. proper dragon size)
	(*) Stopped people from being enough to satisfy a need to see great beasts
	(*) Made visitors less nervous about going to neutral locations

Release notes for 0.43.05 (July 5, 2016):

Here are the first official 64-bit releases!  This would not be possible without help from our community -- you can view the exciting and sometimes late-night discussion over in the 0.43.04 release thread if you want to see how the cake was baked.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.43.01 (May 9, 2016):

A new version number!  With the work order additions and adventurer-created sites, this one ended up with more new stuff and fewer bug fixes than expected, and my version calculator just tipped over at 0.43.  You can use the new 'b' site building option in adventure mode to create a site (outside the bounds of other sites).  For dwarf mode work orders, you can set conditions and details from the manager.  You can also create orders tied to specific shops from their workshop profiles.

A miscellaneous note: in order to retire at the adventurer sites you create, you'll need to name the site, create a main hall zone, and claim the hall during conversation (or while shouting to yourself).

Next up we'll be doing more bug fix releases to make sure we have a vaguely presentable DF before we disappear into a new compiler and 64 bits.

New stuff
	(*) Ability to build up new sites in adv mode, either yourself or by assigning companions
	(*) Ability to do carpentry in adv mode
	(*) Ability to chop down trees in adv mode
	(*) Ability to make stone axes in adv mode
	(*) Ability to pull branches from trees in adv mode
	(*) Can put start conditions on work orders (by amount of resources or dependence on other work orders)
	(*) Can specify materials/images/etc. in work orders
	(*) Can create work order from profile which is tied to specific workshop
	(*) Can set maximum number of shops that a general work order can task at once
	(*) Can set maximum number of general work orders per shop or disallow them by profession or altogether (note: this won't work for active old-save jobs)
	(*) Allowed perpetual work orders
	(*) Repeatable work orders, ability to set restart frequencies

Major bug fixes
	(*) Stopped masterpiece trading from causing artisans to suffer effects of art defacement

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Got rid of work order limit of 30 jobs
	(*) Improved work order filtering (respect partial vs. full results etc.)

Release notes for 0.42.01 (December 1, 2015):

Here is the new version we've been working on all year!  The flow of fortress life is quite a bit different now -- specific breaks and parties have been replaced by taverns and performances and needs and inebriation.  You can designate a tavern, temple or library from a meeting area zone, bedroom or dining room using the new Assign Location option.  The location list ('l') will let you know what sort of furniture and items you need, and you can set tavern keepers, scribes and other occupations there as well.  You'll need to set up a drink stockpile and a chest for goblets in taverns for drink service to work properly, but dwarves can still drink without a tavern as before.  You can assign multiple rooms/zones to a single location.  There's a lot more -- see the feature list below.

The bug fix list below is partial.  Large chunks of the game were changed, which has a way of making old bugs go away while bringing in new ones to take their place.  We'll be focusing on bugs old and new in subsequent releases, starting with crashing saves and moving down the list.  The next set of bug-fix releases will be measured on a scale of days and weeks rather than months, as usual.

New stuff
	(*) Ability to designate taverns, temples and libraries in the fortress
	(*) Taverns and libraries also exist in adventure mode and world generation
	(*) Tavern keepers can serve drinks in both modes, goblets can be used by dwarves to drink (in taverns or otherwise)
	(*) Performances include stories, poetry, music and dance (you can view activity descriptions from the unit/job list)
	(*) Art forms are randomly generated for each civilization
	(*) Instruments are now all generated, instruments can be used in both modes
	(*) Most instruments are constructed from multiple pieces using different materials
	(*) Personalities and values lead to needs which can be met by various actions in both modes
	(*) The fort has visitors, residency petitions and eventual citizenship, including non-dwarves
	(*) Tavern visitors include mercenaries, monster slayers, bandits, diplomats and performers
	(*) Can set details for clothing/armor jobs to make them for other races that can equip items
	(*) Monster slayers can petition your fortress to go down and fight monsters once you discover the underground
	(*) Performance troupes are active in world generation and into play, visiting the fort, can be formed in adventure mode
	(*) New knowledge system divided into nine branches (though it has very few practical effects so far)
	(*) Fortress scholars can advance knowledge, form master-apprentice relationships and write down their findings
	(*) Fortress scribes can copy works in your library
	(*) Scholars can visit your fortress libraries, bringing knowledge from around the world
	(*) Devoted historical figures can visit your fortress temples
	(*) Three forms of writing material: papyrus sheets, paper sheets and parchment sheets
	(*) Papyrus sheets are made directly from the plant at the farmer's workshop
	(*) Paper is made from pressed slurries (start at the quern/mill, then go to a screw press)
	(*) Parchment is made from hide and milk of lime at the tanner's (bake quicklime at a kiln, then make milk of lime at an ashery)
	(*) Sheets are used to make quires or with rollers to make scrolls -- these are then used for writing
	(*) Quires can be bound into codices with bindings after they contain writing
	(*) Dwarves read books in the library (they don't need to be scholars)
	(*) Values can be passed in writing (both modes) and through adventure mode arguments (uses some conversation skills)
	(*) Animal people are playable as adventurers, arrive as fort visitors and sometimes live in towns in (playable) populations
	(*) Children play with toys now, and they can also play make believe, in both modes
	(*) Personality can be customized/randomized in adventure mode, appearance can be randomized as well
	(*) Temples can be defiled in both modes, dwarf temples can be assigned to particular gods
	(*) Adventurer can rent rooms in inns
	(*) Adventurers can compose new poems, music and dances
	(*) Adventurers can write material down on empty quires or scrolls
	(*) Alcohol causes inebriation, erratic behavior, unconsciousness, death
	(*) Festivals occur in world generation, though we haven't gotten them out of there yet
	(*) Dwarves will wear trinkets again

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed some army pathing issues
	(*) Goblins have mounts again
	(*) Fixed long-standing flow bug with unit occupancy
	(*) Stopped some issues with brawls escalating to non-lethal

Other bug fixes/tweaks

	(*) Fixed inversion problem with half of the child/parent conversation thoughts
	(*) Lots of historical figures that weren't around from the beginning didn't have deities when they were supposed to
	(*) Allowed site finder to look for 1x1 sites
	(*) Human civilizations now have randomized values

******************************************************

******************************************************

Here is the job priorities release.  It should work fine with old saves, though existing hauling jobs may need to work themselves out for a bit.  Further job prioritization work can be done when we get through the framework for start scenarios, since we'll better understand how dwarves fit into the fortress at that time.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.16 (November 12, 2014):

The purpose of this release is to make stress from long-term separation due to goblin snatching less severe and to stop attackers from always winning in post-world-generation non-player battles.  The fix for the latter could not be done cleanly at this time, so the battle readouts in legends are a little off compared to the ones from world-gen, but defenders are very often successful now.  I also fixed some missing aunts/uncles/cousins in the listing of relatives.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.14 (October 25, 2014):

Here is the next release.  The focus was not bugs this time, but rather completing the work started on emotions as well as basic fruit harvesting.  A note -- adding stepladders to old saves was not possible, so you'll have to wait for a new world for those.  Fallen fruit can still be gathered in old saves using the new plant gathering zones.  Dwarves in old saves have also had their current thoughts wiped clean to make way for the new emotion/circumstance pairs.

Release notes for 0.40.11 (September 3, 2014):

Here is the first release for September!  As usual, a few bugs like sleep screwups, cowardly companions and wandering children might persist for a while into old saves until the system clears itself out.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Accounted for site populations properly when moving around (stopping doubling in lairs/player forts)
	(*) Removed the old animal people camp items, as they cause duplication errors and will work with a better overall army framework later

	(*) Made chained animal checks respect z coordinate properly

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.10 (August 24, 2014):

Here is another round of fixes.  Note that for morale fixes in old saves there could be some persistent alarm data that causes people to continue to run for a bit, even for a few in-game hours in some cases, so you might need to let things work themselves out.

	(*) Fixed a few typos causing double periods in personality paragraphs

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.09 (August 17, 2014):

The cleaning continues with this release!  Some notes on poles:  For no-pole, you'll need to handle glacier and tundra biomes in one way or another (wider temperature range, remove region requirements, etc.).  For instance, to make a valid no-pole large island, all I needed to do was widen the temperature max/min from 75/25 to 110/-10.  This made a few glaciers and tundras scattered around the world, and it also allowed a few tropical biomes to appear.  For no-pole, base temperatures of at least 85 make an environment tropical (worlds with poles continue to use latitude), though 75 works for certain biomes.  You should be able to input your own temperatures in the txt parameters now without the game applying a polar shift.  No-pole worlds do not yet experience any seasonal temperature variations, and worlds with two poles still have seasons at the same time of year on either side of the equator until that can be made less confusing.

Major bug fixes

	(*) Stopped ghosts from being considered in regular sight code
	(*) Fixed the defend burrow order
	(*) Allowed items made from gem materials (including large gems) to be stored in finished goods pile
	(*) Fixed broken logic that made trade good hauling require both trade good hauling and lever operation labors

Other bug fixes/tweaks

	(*) Added appropriate announcements for some additional circumstances under which a fort dwarf could assume a civ-level position
	(*) Added embark warning if civ is dead
	(*) Added optional confirmation window after preparing embark (default: pops up if points remain)

	(*) Made hill dwarf sites put animals in pastures properly
	(*) Made animals not placed in pasture/waste/yard get placed even if their preferred type isn't available
	(*) Fixed some manual typos (Gorobay)
	(*) Initialized strict pop cap to 220 if not present in d_init

Release notes for 0.40.05 (July 27, 2014):

This is a bug fix and optimization release, which is probably something we should get used to for a while, since there is a lot left to do!  I've tried to make it possible to play in larger worlds again, but there's also more that can be done.

Major bug fixes

	(*) Fixed the population cap
	(*) Made it possible to detect plantings too late in the season again (Quietust)
	(*) Stopped migrants from retaining certain adv/etc. flags harmful to their integration into the fort (making them 'hostile')  Note: those from old saves might take off articles of clothing and store them and other strange things, since the integration could not be made complete easily...

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.04 (July 20, 2014):

This is mainly another crash-fix release, though I was able to handle some other problems as well.  I'm still hoping to get to optimizations (for the third time in these release notes!), but as usual that depends on stability.  As you'll note below, a few of the older bugs are gone -- as we continue in this process, I'll work fixes for old bugs into the mix.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed a crash with pathing for jumps
	(*) Fixed a crash related to invading squads attempting to train
	(*) Fixed an overpopulation bug for civilized critters and a related one for site animals
	(*) Fixed problem with retired fort uniform settings crashing later visits to the fort
	(*) Stopped a crash associated to misplaced books/slabs (root cause remains, added some logs)
	(*) Fixed position appointment issue that caused some instability
	(*) Tried to make idle code somewhat better about climbing while still getting dwarves out from being stuck
	(*) People with a weapon should use it with the proper frequency now

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Fixed problem with animal training/taming vs. lingering combat data (caused job cancel spam and inability to complete jobs)
	(*) Stopped nearby objects from being teleported by construction removal and a related problem with the item loop (ag/Quietust)
	(*) Made site finder properly indicate flux layers (Quietust)
	(*) Made game better respect existing directory structure in data/save when creating new directories
	(*) Made tops of walls appear properly when trees above walls are removed
	(*) Made strangulation take less time
	(*) Enhanced sapling survivability
	(*) Fixed a problem that caused vermin to occasionally be generated out of the loaded area
	(*) Fixed a problem that corrupted the information about items on the ground with temperature changes
	(*) Fixed some brokenness with climbing AI vs. ledge tops
	(*) Fixed a broken instance of chasing opponent AI vs unwalkable spaces
	(*) Made climbing have a higher path cost
	(*) Made people less likely to climb after a failure
	(*) Babies don't start strapped with a knife

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.03 (July 13, 2014):

Many more crash issues fixed.  Mystery babies and large city walls had a corrupting effect that was not possible to manage, so saves are not compatible yet again.  I'll try to keep saves together as we move forward, but there aren't any guarantees, especially this early on.  If things have settled down on the stability front, I can finally move on to the optimizations and other issues.  We'll see what happens!

Major bug fixes
	(*) Fixed relationship screen crash from certain historial/old-player-fort migrants and adventurer migrants
	(*) Fixed adv retirement cloning
	(*) Fixed crash when game tries to realize certain low population sites
	(*) Fixed crash/corruption problem from large city walls
	(*) Fixed crash when asking about site trade partners
	(*) Fixed problem causing travelers originating from realized forts/sewers/dungeons to go out of map bounds (caused crashes)
	(*) Stopped the babies of the world from appearing in the unit list (and associated minimap crash)

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Made farm plant list refresh properly with season selection

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.02 (July 10, 2014):

It's not DF without save corruption!  This release should fix an issue with autosaves corrupting and causing various crash issues down the line.  For this reason 0.40.01 saves are not compatible with this version -- I'm going to try to avoid compatibility breaks as we go, but sometimes they happen.  I've also fixed the talk-to-deity crash (closely related to the shout-when-nobody-is-around crash, also fixed), the blocking crash, and some other bad issues.  Due to the save corruption, I didn't get a chance to work on the calendar speed, but assuming this release works as planned, I should be able to jump into that now.

Major bug fixes
	(*) Stopped autosave features from corrupting worlds (thanks to everybody that helped sort that out so quickly!)
	(*) Made the game not crash when talking to a deity or shouting out in the wilderness
	(*) Fixed a crash from trying to actively block in the adventure attack menu
	(*) Fixed the size bug where 9 of 10 young critters did not grow up beyond baby size (thanks Urist Da Vinci and so many others for all the work on that!  I'd thank you all properly if I could do the archaeology to figure out how it was sorted out...)
	(*) Fixed a crash that came sometimes when asking about the position of site forces
	(*) Stopped a freeze that happened when swimming in deep water

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Fixed the tracking key in the SDL version so you should be able to do that with capital K now
	(*) Added the short wait button to the adventurer manual -- you can use , instead of . to wait for one instant
	(*) Made quarry bushes process to an edible leaf properly
	(*) Typo when impersonating divine being

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.40.01 (July 7, 2014):

Here is the world activation release!  Lots of processes from world generation -- birth, invasions, succession, site foundation, and so on -- now operate in the world after play has begun.  Getting all of that to work led to a meandering route through various pieces of the game, some of which are described below.  Aside from any bugginess, a lot of it will still feel rough and unfinished as things bump around.

New stuff
	(*) World activation!  There are a few things that aren't active, like megabeast invasions, but lots of world gen actions made it into the game.  Birth, death (to the extent it wasn't handled before), marriages, site foundation as well as reclaims, basic succession and appointments/etc., invasions, as well as some more detail beyond world gen, like patrols, banditry and animal population handling.  We still don't have army battles -- the invasions are all successful right now, unless they are locally interfered with by you.
	(*) The game advances two weeks before each play -- the calendar there still moves slowly when there's a lot of action, as there is in larger worlds, but there are quite a few things I can do soon to speed that up.  Due to the speed of the calendar, new forts in particular also get just two weeks.  This'll probably cause some shenanigans with the caravan (or you'll just have to wait a year in an autumn fort for your first one) until we sort it out.
	(*) Fortresses can be retired and unretired.  Losing is still fun but if it doesn't happen when you want, you can put it off for a while.  Retired forts can be conquered (much more easily than they would be if you still controlled them), so don't be surprised if you have to reclaim instead of being able to unretire sometimes.  You can reclaim forts that didn't make it through world generation.
	(*) Site maps for dwarves, elves and goblins.  These are very basic, but they are there, anyway.
	(*) Multi-tile trees and lots of new plants.  Fruit and flowers.  Leaves that fall in little clouds.  I had to put off dwarf mode tree harvesting, but we should get to that before long.
	(*) Megabeasts/forgotten beasts can attack, destroy and then reside within world gen sites like dwarf fortresses.
	(*) Various movement changes.  Climbing/jumping/sprinting in both modes, though invaders still require a line of site to use them.  Adventure mode has a stealth rewrite, and some elements of that are present in dwarf mode (it is generally easier to spot thieves and ambushers, and I'll probably need to make them smarter about finding cover).  Movement and combat are separate now.  Startled people climb up the walls of their homes a little too often.
	(*) Tracking information in adventure mode.  You can pull up a little window and see tracks (capital K), and you can also have it describe the freshest track that isn't yours to more easily stay on a trail (alt K).  Tracks are also part of the regular look command.
	(*) Different levels of conflict -- your opponents in adventure mode will be listed with the current status (non-lethal, lethal, no quarter, etc.).
	(*) Combat moves take place over a period of time now, and you can do things like catching an opponent's attack -- you have to do that by targeting a grab at the offending part now (reactions used to have a menu, but that was before combat got more smeared out).  You can get information about what attacks your opponent is doing in the attack menu -- the quality of the information depends on your situational awareness skill.  You can add adjective modifiers to your attacks (quick/heavy/etc.) and you can perform more than one attack at a time for a significant penalty to its force.  It might make sense with two adamantine swords or something, twirling them about.
	(*) Rumors of incidents can be spread, and the rumors need to be spread before you gain reputation (good or bad).  Killing all of the witnesses to an event will effectively remove it from play if you don't let them get off the screen.  People are a little psychic as it regards ongoing conflicts, so that they can make decisions non-stupidly.  Your liaison can share rumors with your fort, but I still need to set up the screen for reviewing them after you've seen them the first time...  not that you can do much with the information.
	(*) You can travel through tunnels.
	(*) You can get a guide to travel with you to a faraway place -- it still ended up being too cumbersome, so locals continue to be able to tell you the location of sites, but only within a certain distance of their home town.
	(*) In general, conversations have been redone.  They no longer have their own screen, but run along with other actions, and there are many more options.
	(*) The mind has been rewritten quite a bit -- people now experience emotions according to different circumstances (lots of awkward monologues there), and they consider actions differently.  The main outstanding issue is that I didn't get around to converting existing dwarf mode thoughts, so they sort of exist concurrently with the new emotions and that needs to be changed.  I'll get to that before job priorities (which was one of the main shorter-term reasons for the rewrite).  Some dwarves have life-long dreams and it is possible for them to recognize that they've accomplished the ones relating to skills and family.  They cannot yet realize their dreams of taking over the world.
	(*) The paragraph at the beginning of adventure mode was marginally more useful, but that slipped a bit at the end as things were tweaked.  I think it'll still describe certain invasions and abductions, but it needs to be redone.
	(*) Lots of new arena options -- not just the conflict state, but you can set the temperature etc. to all sorts of extremes.
	(*) Some experiments with procedural items, though the new demon-type sites are still quite un-fun now.  The knowledge on the slab at the bottom can be used, but it is probably not worth the trouble.
	(*) The stuff I forgot

Bug fixes
	(*) I'm sure several old bugs were "fixed" as large portions of the code was rewritten/removed, but I haven't tried to track exactly which ones.  Bug fixes will commence in earnest now, and everything will be handled over at the bug tracker http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/.

Release notes for 0.34.08 (May 14, 2012):

Here is a hauling release.  I'm sure it has all kinds of interesting issues -- we're going to iron out problems for the next few releases without embarking on anything major in order to restabilize it.  The tile-wise physics causes some oddities on its own (items can't be given a meaningful sub-tile width, so they act a bit strangely if you look at the collisions closely).  Dwarves are also a bit enthusiastic with their new bin/barrel jobs -- when they grab a bin/barrel to load it up, it might have objects in it, and that might lead to conflicts/false shortages on occasion.  We'll have to continue playing around with it.  As far as I can tell, old saves load up fine and have usable minecart/wheelbarrows, so feel free to move your data/save folder over to the new version.  You'll notice your old save stone haulers moving slower -- get some wheelbarrows built at the carpenter's for your stone stockpiles to alleviate that problem.

New stuff
	(*) Minecarts can be used to haul things around on carved/constructed tracks/bridges ('h'auling to set up routes)
	(*) Dwarves can be set to guide, push off, or ride carts that are ready to move to the next stop
	(*) Track stops used to slow/stop cart and/or dump the contents on vehicle entry, can be disengaged with lever/plate
	(*) Pressure plates can be triggered by carts
	(*) Rollers can be used to push cart along when powered
	(*) Minecarts limited to one per tile in general, various collisions can occur
	(*) Wheelbarrows can be linked to stockpiles in order to move heavy objects (it'll auto-request one for stone stockpiles)
	(*) Falling objects can collide with critters
	(*) Camera can be attached to unit or item, can be linked to hotkeys from the unit/item screens

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) Stockpiles can be linked to workshops, can be set to give to multiple piles, can be set to accept items from links only
	(*) Hauling jobs will often be combined, using one container
	(*) Heavy items harder to haul
	(*) Densities/colors updated, based on Uristocrat's data collection thread
	(*) Can filter creature names in arena
	(*) Mine drop rates tweaked, no longer skill-based
	(*) Puzzleboxes/drum makeable
	(*) Stopped blinking on bridges
	(*) Projectiles using new code (most non-shot/thrown projectiles) can skip/skid on liquid/ground
	(*) All flying units use new minecart parabolic flight paths
	(*) Many projectiles do not resolve in adventure mode before your turn (so you can dodge a flying cart by moving away)
	(*) Can create/assign to squads from v-p
	(*) Squads can be given nicknames from v-p or the military screen
	(*) Fixed broken clay stockpile option

The necromancer crash was coming up so often in crash reports that I figured now was a good time for another release.  Here it is!

Release notes for 0.34.03 (February 28, 2012):

Release notes for 0.31.20/21 (March 6, 2011):

This is the first bug fix release for 0.31.19, where I've focused on new bugs.  The fixes are listed below.  It also includes a few sponsored critters (pandas and capybaras), as well as some of their wilder relatives.  Pandas are restricted to bamboo grazing and capybaras can vocalize in adv mode (bark, whistle, etc).  I added a mineral availability parameter that you can set from Create World Now or from the detailed parameter screen.  There are a few more things I can do there, but any extensive rewrite is going to have to wait for 3D veins and mine maps (Release 2 in the schedule).  Barring any catastrophes, we'll be moving on to the old-bug-fixing now.

Release notes for 0.31.19 (February 16, 2011):

This is the first release of what we once called the Caravan Arc, where we'll be changing how trade and the economy work.  The entire release schedule is up at http://bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html.  This particular release doesn't have visible changes to trade -- just a lot of world generation infrastructure.  People eat and starve in world gen now, though it doesn't matter afterward.  Subsequent releases coming up will be making use of these changes during play, but don't expect too much there this time.  There have been many other changes.  Seeing most of them will require generating a new world.

There are lots of new domestic animals.  We also added giraffes, rhinos, honey bees and bumblebees.  Bees were the winner of the animal sponsorship drive and they had many associated jobs, so we didn't try to get into the other sponsored beasts, but we'll be adding those in with every release.

Animals can be placed in pen/pasture zones, and grazing animals will need to graze on grass (they can also eat underground fungus found in many open cave layers).  Pastures should be made large enough to provide ample grass and to prevent animals from being stacked on top of each other.  Animals crammed into one place for too long can become grumpy and violent, but the animals will stay in the pastures without much tending (a dwarf may occasionally run over to an animal if it wanders off the pasture border to walk around something).  There is no way to trade for hay or animal feed at this time, so don't expect grazing animals in new forts to survive on glaciers or the deepest deserts.  Many deserts have patches of grass (or succulents) now.

Sheep, llamas and alpacas (and trolls for goblins) can be sheared and the wool can be spun into yarn.  Chickens and other birds will lay eggs in nest boxes if you place the boxes in accessible areas.  You can mill rocknuts into paste and press the paste for oil (which goes into jugs).  Pressing occurs at the new screw press building.

You can make many of the more clayish soil types into earthenware ceramics now (and you can make fire clay into stoneware and kaolinite into porcelain).  If a fort embark location has clay above the aquifer (or any clay if there is no aquifer), it'll be displayed in the embark readout.  I didn't get very far into glazing, but you can ash glaze and tin glaze (with cassiterite).  Earthenware jugs need to be glazed to hold liquids.  Stoneware and porcelain jugs don't require glaze but can be glazed.  You can also make large pots out of various materials, and these act like barrels (they are associated to stockpiles in the same way, etc.).

Honey bees can be collected and kept in artificial hives (which you can make out of various materials).  You'll need one natural hive on your embark location to get started, but after that you can split the colony into new artificial hives.  The process is fairly automated.  You just need to place the hive buildings and a beekeeper will do the rest.  You can adjust a few settings on each hive to control which hives are held for splitting and which are collected.  You'll need to have jugs around to collect honeycombs (the royal jelly holds up the process otherwise), and you'll need another jug to collect the honey.  Wax cakes can only be made into crafts by a wax worker at this time.

The site finder records the best hit in each square now, and you can stop the finder at any time and browse the results.  The categories and readout have been changed up a bit.  Minerals have been redistributed on the world map, though this might not be satisfying as I was expecting to get a bit farther with dwarf mode trade.  Adjustments might have to be made there until trade is updated.  We'll see.

Animals and plants occur with more or less contiguous ranges now, respecting biome.  There are specific grasses.  The evil grasses are probably a little extreme and seizure-inducing.  I might throttle that back.

I'm starting the first one to two week bug fix cycle now, so there weren't a lot of bug fixes for this release, but creatures, items and vegetation don't pick up as many contaminants now.

There are new options in the graphical map export from legends mode, and I fixed a bug there with village maps getting cut off.

For a list of the new tags available for modding (container reagents in reactions, etc.) see file_changes.txt or the new stock reactions.

Release notes for 0.31.18 (November 16, 2010):

This one fixes up several crashes and other problems.  Maybe most notably, the problem where you'd become a criminal in adventure mode just by going back to a store, the handedness issue with uniform assignments (it might take it a while to clear out problems in old saves, and I can only state this as confidently as the tests I performed), and SDL movie recording.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.17 (November 11, 2010):

If you want to try out the improvements to adventure mode, I'd recommend generating a new world with at least 100 years of history.  I tried out adventuring in a world from 0.31.03, and it technically worked, but there wasn't much to do.  The reason I recommend some history is just to let the beasts get settled a bit, though it's not strictly required.  We haven't gotten threats moving around and arising during actual play yet, so your worlds will inevitably run out of adventure opportunities as you exhaust them, and games tend to be fast-paced and brief overall once you get the hang of it.  This will change during the next few major releases.  There's an update to the "Your First Adventurer" manual section that might be worth glancing at even if you have played an adventurer before.  Don't be surprised if you die learning a few facts about the world.

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed problem with baron not arriving due to stale merchant reports
	(*)stopped old jobs/projectiles from tying up items on reclaim

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)changed ring/bracelet symbol to make way for adv mode tools
	(*)cut kill-bragging to 5 kills
	(*)fixed bug through which demon could take over two or more civs in one year
	(*)name change: graveyard -> corpses (since it isn't appropriate for final burial)
	(*)stopped occupancy from being erased upon entering adv mode in arena
	(*)allowed labors to be toggled by category
	(*)added standing order for outdoor vermin refuse
	(*)fixed erroneous material bonuses in world gen fights
	(*)updated wrestling interface
	(*)implemented text for wrestling attacks
	(*)changed combat announcement colors and stun/paralyze color to light blue from light cyan
	(*)toes/fingers protected by armor
	(*)elves are now small e's to match their size
	(*)different soldier/civilian symbols for human/elf (as with the two dwarf symbols)
	(*)stopped triggerable vermin groups from becoming visible occasionally
	(*)fixed some old problems where input wasn't registering properly on movement, etc.
	(*)disabled need to eat/drink in adv mode until we get some more general work in
	(*)various minor adv mode tweaks and fixes

New stuff
	(*)added night creatures
	(*)added lairs for some creatures
	(*)added new travel screen (old worlds might have misplaced moons in the sky bar)
	(*)updated how adv mode sleep works, permission to sleep in buildings

	(*)added (harder) rolling away for dodgers on the ground

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.16 (October 4, 2010):

Hopefully this one doesn't have any weird new issues.  That bumpy lag should be gone now, and there are expanded refuse pile options.  You can also turn off having your dwarves track around blood (it starts off in the init).  I left it on in adventure mode, but you can turn it off there too if you want.

Major bug fixes
	(*)got rid of intermittent lag that popped up in 0.31.15

New stuff
	(*)added spatter init options (dwarf mode defaults to no walking spread of spatter)
	(*)allowed skull/bone/shell/tooth/horn settings from refuse pile

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.15 (October 3, 2010):

The purpose of this release is to restore the missing invasions, and I threw in some easy fixes on top of it, mostly to the raws.

Major bug fixes
	(*)made invasions come again

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)lots of raw fixes (see "file changes.txt")
	(*)made reactions show the proper building
	(*)made LEAVES load the 'character' style tile properly
	(*)corrected labor name "soap maker" -> "soap making"
	(*)fixed typo in world gen rejection dialog for missing civ definitions
	(*)fixed spelling of chinchilla for forgotten beasts (new ones only)

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.14 (September 23, 2010):

The main issues here were to handle the new bugs from 0.31.13 which were gumming things up (broken migration, undiggable adamantine) and to address site sprawl concerns a bit.  To the latter end, there's a new world gen option to limit the total number of sites and I've added a few options to "Create World Now!" to make use of that.  It's not going to be truly satisfying until dwarven sprawl is better defined and there are more things to do with the sprawl in adventure mode and in dwarf mode wars, but overall I don't plan to decrease the amount of sprawl drastically on default settings once that is handled -- sprawl will likely increase again once memory problems are addressed, there are more things to do with it, and it shifts more dynamically over long periods of time (improved war, disease, famine, migrations, etc).  For now you can control sprawl with the site cap, with the civilization number, with the savagery, and with the history end year from the "Create World Now!" menu without much fuss (and the default setting is much lighter on sprawl than the default in 0.31.13).

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed problems with immigrants having strange unit types and erroneous announcements about terrifying forts
	(*)allowed raw adamantine to be diggable now by adding a new tag to slade for the time being.  There is a side effect -- slade in old saves will be diggable.  Add [UNDIGGABLE] to slade in the save's raws in inorganic_stone_mineral.txt in your save to fix that.  If you choose to dig through the slade, please don't report any associated bugs.  The game likely won't be able to deal with it properly.

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)fixed plant text in food preferences and stopped generated forgotten beasts etc. from being chosen

New stuff
	(*)added site cap option to world gen parameters
	(*)added beast cap options to world gen parameters
	(*)added a few options to "create world now"

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.13 (September 15, 2010):

The framework for villages and sprawl is in place, and there are now "entity populations" which are made up of thousands of critters for which less information is tracked.  As it stands, this amounts to, say, ten times the number of historical figures after world generation has been running for a while, though it can vary a lot.  These changes have left adventure mode gutted, so don't expect old adventure mode saves to retain much information or work all that well.  Old dwarf mode saves should be fine for continued dwarf fortresses.  In new worlds, you can wander around the new villages, but don't expect anything to be going on.  This is the launching pad for what should be the Funification of adventure mode in the next (non-fix) release, but like many launching pads, it is kind of dull and gray.

As for the merits of this release, there are the bug fixes in the lists below.  The game should also be a bit faster.  I'm on a new compiler in Windows, which led to a general speed increase, and I also optimized some code for improvements on all OSs.  It's not the end of the story there by a long shot, but it is progress, anyway.  World generation itself might be a bit slower overall, since there's a lot more going on site-wise.  This is going to change as we set up relationships between the leaders, one way or another, but I can make a medium island world in around 10 minutes without the memory going totally nuts, and I thought that state was fit for release.

There are some side effects to not having any stable relationships between world gen sites while cutting down on site destructions, like having a site get pillaged for the thousandth time and so on, which will iron themselves out later.  For now, it's a bit weird.  I also saw a battle with negative numbers of soldiers but couldn't reproduce the situation, so there are probably additional issues as well.

The SDL version has the first pass at the experimental TrueType font support that Baughn is working on.  It is off by default in init.txt and it only works in the 2D print mode.  There are lots of justification etc. problems -- you don't need to report those.  Getting those fixed up is part of the process.  It's difficult to read in the standard window size, so you might want to limit yourself to full-screen or a large window with large grid cells when you are trying it out.

Crash fixes
	(*)fixed some potential problems with aborting zone placement, though it's not guaranteed to solve the crash there

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed problem causing dwarves to not sleep in any bed
	(*)fixed problem causing dwarves not to respect ownership in sleeping priorities
	(*)made cursor center on buildings properly when linking them up to a lever etc.
	(*)stopped other civilizations from bringing liaisons
	(*)stopped building destroyer diplomats/traders from destroying things
	(*)made units check the validity of targets more often (counters certain interrupt spam)

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)fixed broken vial making jobs
	(*)make rock short swords use the proper material for the final product
	(*)made horn silver use the stone template
	(*)moved all native metals off of metal template
	(*)stopped season counter from resetting to spring after travel in adventure mode

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.12 (July 25, 2010):

Aside from the major bug fixes listed below, I made skill increases a little faster during training.  Part of the problem is with how classes work -- the teacher and student skills are important, and they can heavily amplify the effects, so the gains for people without those skills were small.  Now it'll be even more extreme that the base rate has increased, so we'll have to see how that plays out in forts that get good teachers.

If your old fort has a dead liaison, your replacement liaison will be named after one of the standard professions most likely, but they should still perform their job.  New worlds should have dead liaisons kicked out completely and get new liaisons.

Crash fixes
	(*)fixed military training crash
	(*)fixed a crash during dwarf creation in arena mode after dwarf mode game had been played
	(*)fullscreen/windowed mode switch crash fixed (Baughn)

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed new liaison coming when previous liaison is unavailable for any reason
	(*)fixed problem which stopped the liaison from talking about making a barony

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)adjusted skill rates up a bit on indiv training and demonstrations
	(*)made att/skill rate loader treat 0s like NONE instead of the fastest rate

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.11 (July 23, 2010):

Combat was the focus last time, and this time I moved over to equipment and training.  There are a number of bugs left to fix, but a lot of the largest problems should be cleaned up and training should be somewhat usable now.  I wanted to shift ammunition over to a default system where it doesn't get tied to particular squads/hunters (with the old way left as a default for people that want to control it more), since that remains one of the more annoying things, but I didn't have time to finish it up.  Just make sure you have some extra bolts sitting around, and 'm'-'f' should show you how your squads are doing ammo-wise.  Barracks should also probably default to a non-reserved/non-purposed system, though that's not as bad as ammunition reservation is.  In any case, I'll be moving on to the month-end project and entity populations, though I'll release again sooner if something comes up.

Crash fixes
	(*)stopped crash when individual squad members were selected in 's' and you go back to 's' after leaving
	(*)fixed crash moving from ammo assignment creation to material assignment

	(*)stopped off-time training from gumming up squad training barracks assignment
	(*)removed dead/crazy/etc. dwarves from squads
	(*)dropped injured dwarves out of their activities properly
	(*)stopped bleeding dwarves from thinking they need to jump on the ground and be dragged to the hospital
	(*)stopped miners/woodcutters coming out of the military from thinking they had a claim to old tools
	(*)made people doing off-time training stop if it becomes inappropriate (kicked out of squad, etc.)
	(*)made quota countdown respect reactions again

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)stopped body-component-based artifacts from defaulting out to iron figurines

	(*)restricted shell moods to dwarves with shell prefs

	(*)adjusted skill rates for all practice activities
	(*)put forest start biome on humans (for proactive forest clearing)

(*)fixed problem where your units would not recognize the nice people arriving on business as their friends
(*)stopped problem where removing a worn object in adv mode could leave you with two copies
(*)stopped seg-fault at quit in linux if sound wasn't initialized (oliver)

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.09 (July 10, 2010):

Lots of combat changes this time.  Keep in mind that old saves use the old raws, so you'll want to copy over at least item_weapon.txt, item_ammo.txt and inorganic_metal.txt to get more of the positive effects.  The adventure mode stone-making ability won't be available in old saves but butchery will be.

Crash fixes

	(*)extended distance at which hunters are willing to shoot
	(*)made hunters return kills under more circumstances

Crash fixes
	(*) SDL graphics mode should work now (Baughn)
	(*) creating squads in Linux shouldn't crash the game now
	(*) stopped melting items from eventually crashing the game

Major bug fixes
	(*) animals/babies no longer try to clean themselves at water sources
	(*) stopped losers from keeping their positions at elections (could not easily repair old saves with this problem though)
	(*) fixed problem where ID numbers would be invalid on load after generating a world
	(*) adjusted seasonal temperatures (should actually fix the rain bug)
	(*) SDL grid sizes no longer stuck on 80x25 if you let intro movies play (Baughn)

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) site finder will advanec without keypresses now
	(*) SDL version 2D mode colors are corrected (Baughn)
	(*) stopped cursor from skipping over large entries in stocks screen in SDL versions (Baughn)
	(*) ESC no longer quits SDL keybinding screens instead of going up a level (Baughn)
	(*) slow SDL unit offloading and other similar problems sped up (Baughn)

New stuff

	(*) can set held key repetition behavior in SDL versions from init.txt (Baughn)
	(*) SDL version 2D mode now allows zooming (Baughn)


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.04 (May 16, 2010):

The main thing here is the new OpenGL code by Svein Ove Aas (Baughn).  Especially if you weren't running at maximum framerates even on the title screen, you should notice a great improvement.  There are some modes worth messing around with in data/init/init.txt -- try "2D" if the game does not work as well as it used to (or stick with the legacy version if truly necessary).

You can get at macros with:
	Ctrl+r = record
	Ctrl+p = play
	Ctrl+s = save
	Ctrl+l = load
There is a directory data/init/macros for them.

You can use PNGs for (translucent) tilesets, you can resize the window using the border, you can zoom using the mouse wheel (reset with F10, you can rebind this to keys if you like) and multiple keys can be bound to one command.

A lot of changes were necessary to get this running, so there are likely to be a variety of bugs.  The legacy version has also been reorganized to make releases easier, so there could be new bugs even there.

Aside from that, we have some general fixes:

Crash fixes
	(*) stopped site finder from eating up a ton of memory (crashing the game on large maps)

Major bug fixes
	(*) changed day/night temperature calculations (fixes fish availability and melting in the rain)
	(*) stopped suture and dressing jobs from being repeated over and over on healed wounds

Minor changes
	(*) made all vermin and smallish outdoor corpse items disappear over time (can be hit after a month for vermin, season for corpse chunks)
	(*) changed ranges for adv mode temperature text
	(*) made temperature of squares adjacent to lava slightly lower


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.03 (April 12, 2010):

I handled some more crashes and the main pathing issue.  Undead aren't quite where they need to be yet (skeletons in particular still don't understand how the skull and spine should be holding them together), but they are more killable in this version.  Since they don't make sense in the first place, there's a sort of hitpoint system for them now that'll get them dead eventually if you don't break them apart, though punching a skeleton to death takes a long time in this system and maces are still a bit underpowered.  The undead HP will be revisited once the undead have more of a basis in the underlying reality.  I'll get to maces etc. sooner.

Crash fixes
	(*) fixed a zone deletion crash (only for zones with buildings in them)
	(*) fixed crash in military screen upon switching to item assignment view when no squads were present
	(*) fixed crash from copying a schedule cell with fewer orders to one with more
	(*) fixed crash from changing alert view while scrolling through a schedule cells orders

Major bug fixes
	(*) fixed pathing problem (root cause was map generation vs. liquids, would mess up ramps/channels and more)
	(*) stopped missing undead/melted/etc. tissues holding parts from being severed

New stuff
	(*) allowed undead in arena
	(*) allowed undead to be killed by accumulated impacts for the time being while they don't make sense
	(*) stopped people from trying to wrestle the undead at all

Minor changes
	(*) messed with corpse piece colors a bit
	(*) fixed "and" spacing in stripe/spot descriptions
	(*) fixed nervous mannerism typo
	(*) fixed some raw typos (see file_changes.txt)

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.02 (April 8, 2010):

Here's the first little update.  Things are still settling down after the release, but it looks like I'll be able to work with the new bug tracker and handle things there day by day.  There will be a few more of these small releases before I begin the SDL/Mac/Linux/40d# merge, since there are more crashes and huge problems, but I'm going to start some of the preparation for the merge as well.

Crash fixes
	(*) [GRAPHICS:YES] should no longer crash the arena or world generation
	(*) fixed training activity crash (from removal of barracks)
	(*) fixed crash from doing a large flow-style activity zone

Minor changes
	(*) made zone removal still work if flows are corrected (uses rectangles)
	(*) made material projectile breath happen intermittently properly
	(*) corrected gorlak color
	(*) made blind cave bears eyeless and gave them extravision
	(*) fixed broken eyelid relationships
	(*) fixed broken child names for goat/unicorn/cave swallow
	(*) swapped giant caste names
	(*) fixed giant cave spider bite (was blunt)
	(*) fixed alligator eye text
	(*) made soap bars instead of globs
	(*) fixed horn silver environment
	(*) added cookability/vermin eating to meat material templates
	(*) added cookability/vermin eating to plant leaf/seed materials

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.01 (April 1, 2010):

It has been a long journey, and it is ongoing.  This release has all of the new stuff we've been talking about for more than a year, but it is quite buggy.  I also still need to do the merge with the OpenGL/Mac/Linux stuff as I mentioned in the dev log.  We have a new bug tracker at http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/ which we are going to try out.  Expect it to be populated over the next few days with hundreds of issues.  All the same, the testers seemed to be able to enjoy themselves, so please try everything out and have fun!

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40d (September 6, 2008):

I decided to release the current bug fixes since a few of them involve patching up submitted saves and I wanted to get those out before I'm forced to break save compatibility for the next version.  I'll still be able to look at all previously submitted saves (and any saves submitted against this version), but fixes won't apply to the saves themselves as the next release won't be able to load them.

Minor Changes
	(*) made sparring dwarves work on their selected weapon/unarmed skills rather than using their best skills

Bug Fixes:
	(*) stopped thrown tantrum items from causing dwarf to become site enemy
	(*) resolved shared item conflicts during map offloads
	(*) prevented units with shared items (eg stuckins/wrestles) from leaving the dwarf mode play area
	(*) got rid of world gen crash during succession after death of prolific long-standing position holders with inbred descendants
	(*) fixed crash from human siege campfires
	(*) stopped dwarves from taking their current hauled object off to bed when they schedule a rest due to injuries
	(*) stopped dwarves from choosing to sleep on top of traps
	(*) made adventure mode store transactions respect containment
	(*) made combat-produced chunks respect forbid orders
	(*) made cats able to carry vermin properly again
	(*) got rid of erroneous goblin siege announcement for elves
	(*) stopped custom profession names from obscuring recruitment announcements
	(*) made forbidden items count toward wealth properly
	(*) stopped fell moods from occurring if the fortress race does not drop a corpse

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40c (August 21, 2008):

Coffee'd up and fixed a display thing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40b (August 21, 2008):

Another one.  The partial print for graphics has been changed to a default-no init option, so if you weren't having display trouble and had a better framerate, you should turn it on.  It's in data/init/init.txt and it's called "PARTIAL_PRINT".  It'll probably take a while to resolve issues for everyone else.

Minor Changes:
	(*) added an init option for partial screen refreshes (defaults to off)
	(*) added windowed/fullscreen grid sizes

Bug Fixes:
	(*) stopped designation cursor from leaving a trail when the minimap is updating
	(*) fixed reclaim crash from units holding multigrasp clothing
	(*) fixed lockup for glassmaker moods where the glassmaker doesn't like glass
	(*) handled some other potential multigrasp inventory indexing issues
	(*) fixed problem potentially capping caravan wagon number at 2
	(*) handled new forbid orders vs. butchery, severs and sever-drops
	(*) fixed problem with delay on up digging tasks
	(*) fixed problem causing single tile mountain civs from using feature plants
	(*) fixed wagon occupancy problem leaving behind flags that stopped construction
	(*) stopped reclaim from creating a second site at the spot
	(*) stopped dirt road construction at glacier/stone interface
	(*) fixed problem with map export and flashing job markers

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40a (August 18, 2008):

Here's another one.  Hopefully I can transition to some new features next month, since I've been handling technical issues and problems for a while now.

Additions:
	(*) you can save your embark settings for later use
	(*) added note-taking ability for embark screen
	(*) added forbid-on-death orders for your corpses, other non-hunted corpses, your items and other items
	(*) added forbid order for fired projectiles
	(*) made dwarves prefer to combine items in existing bags/barrels/bins with init options to govern this behavior

	(*) did some display optimizations

Bug fixes:
	(*) fixed problem causing site finder to miss areas of the map when hunting for hidden features and rivers

	(*) made zombie/skels that die in cages have proper corpses

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.39f:

More fixes, a bit of work toward armies and caravans, and an expandable view.  If you want to try different grid dimensions, change the relevant entry [GRID:80:25] near the top of data/init/init.txt.  You'll also have to adjust your window size or full screen resolution to match if you don't want the new, larger grid to be squashed.  If you overshoot, it'll stretch them unless you turn black space on.

Additions:
	(*) allowed basic expansion of 80x25 grid
	(*) gave world gen refugees entities and realized them as moving groups on the map after world gen
	(*) added notification and history event for reaching summits of peaks and volcanos in adv mode

Minor Changes:

	(*) fixed lockup from dragon fire modded civs in world gen army fights

******************************************************

Another quick patch.
	(*) stopped crash in site finder from large x dims
	(*) changed designation selection timers (aka lazy miners)
	(*) made site finder use embark rectangle size from init options

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.39d:

This is the third and final fix release, barring any silliness that forces another quick patch.  Here's the complete list of changes:

******************************************************

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.39b:

This is the first fix for the new world generation release.  Here's the complete list of changes:
	(*) fixed bug causing dwarves and others to sleep forever

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.39a:

Okay, here's the new version.  You can do various things with world generation, though not much has changed with the regular game.  If you go into the world generation advanced parameters and start designing/drawing your own world, please keep in mind that you'll probably end up getting infinite reject cycles -- you can turn on the reject log in data/init/init.txt to see what's going wrong.  Oftentimes you'll be violating biome restrictions (you can just go through any that you find and 'n'ullify them to solve this problem).  As usual, let me know if it crashes and how to make it crash if it does -- I suspect there are new problems of all sorts lurking within every part of the game, despite having fixed more than 100 bugs for this version.

Save compatibility is a little iffy this time around -- there have been extensive changes to the mid-level maps, so it might get confused about the biome of a particular tile...  and worse.  I haven't noticed anything in limited messing around with old saves, but there will very likely be problems.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38c:

This release should stop the command line crash from non-standard worlds, and it also has a shot at stopping the site sprawl issue during repeated world generation.  A fix for Power PC Macs is still in progress.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38b:

This is the first Mac release.  Barring some tragic mistake, this is also the last bug fix release before the continuation of the Army Arc.  Again, this release is made up mostly of small changes that people wanted and some bug fixes for the worst problems introduced during the last release.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38a:

Various little things that people have wanted for a while this time, as well as many additional bug fixes.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.173.38a:

The first army arc release, complete with no armies.  It really is mostly foundational work, but you'll notice some small changes here and there, more if you play adventure mode.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33g:

A few more fixes, a few new init options and a new interface for bringing items to the trade depot.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33f:

Various fixes people have been waiting for.  Fixed the farm problem from 33e, goblin sieges, mud tracking, made the treeline less annoying, made the missing gemstones available, and lots of other stuff.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33e:

Continuing along with bug fixing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33d:

Fixed a few of the serious problems (one of the trade crashes, resting injury loops, waterskin filling at wells forever).  See the dev log for other minor changes.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33c:

Continuing along with bug fixing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33b:

Various crash and lag fixes again.  See the dev log for other minor changes.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33a:

Various crash and lag fixes.  There are still lags and crashes, but many of the major offenders have been handled now.  There were also several minor fixes.  See the dev log for those.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.32a:

Well, it has been a while.  That means potential instability, so don't get too attached to your fortresses at this point.  I'll be doing subsequent releases more often now as I solve problems.  In any case, dwarf mode now has a z-axis and you can make fortresses that span several levels.  Fluids behave much more reasonably, and you can walk across the world in adventure mode in the local view without having to step off of an artificial edge.  And various other lots more stuff.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.23.125.23a:

The backbone of temperature is in now, but there's still a lot to do.  I'm not working on it for a while again.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.123.23a:

A bug fix release along with a test-change for the FPS toggling.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.121.23b:

Few more crash bug fixes and several minor changes.

If you are having speed trouble, you can go to init and turn off temperature and weather to see if that's the issue.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.121.23a:

Here are some fixes for crash problems.  I've also added metal bins and more information to the sites in the setup screen.  I fixed the FPS/black space problems with the BMP export options and a few other minor problems as well.

There are still potentially serious problems from the temperature and other recent additions.  I'm going to continue working on bugs for the time being.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.120.23b:

I'm partly through the temperature rewrite.  This release has a lot of bug potential.  You should back up your save folders if you are updating from an older version.

You can set fire to shrubs as an adventurer using the [g] command when you are standing near one.  This is not a permanent command.

The temperature behavior of flows has not been implemented yet.  Very hot/cold creatures do not change the air temperature yet either.  There are a number of features that are in progress regarding temperature.

The problem with dwarves being stuck outside during the stay-inside order should be fixed, as well as a number of other bugs.  You can now move the cursor quickly by using shift + direction.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.120.23a:

Lots of bugs fixed this time around.  I caught a lot of the stay-inside problems, but there are probably some new issues with random jobs now.  I'll fix these as I hear about them.  I'll also correct any additional stay-inside problems as I hear about them.  It should be easier now that more infrastructure is in place.

There's also some creature graphics stuff you can play with.  See "raw/graphics/graphics_example.txt" to mess around with it.  You'll also need to set [GRAPHICS:YES] in "init/init.txt".  I only drew a miner picture, and a blobby dwarf thing, so I don't recommend this unless you are going to draw/use some additional tiles.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23c:

Quick fix for missing color definition problem.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23b:

Quick fix for dyes and a crash bug with inventories in adventure mode.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23a:

There were various cosmetic changes to the game, mainly the addition of dyes and more art images.  The selection of dyes is very limited at present, and only involves ground plants.  There is a new workshop for this in dwarf mode.  You can use blue mushrooms or import other dyes from human traders.  This will be expanded later.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22f:

This release is mainly to handle the issues with specific piles.  There are a few other bug fixes as well.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22e:

Fixed a save corrupting problem.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22d:

Quick patch for a crash bug from saving furniture piles.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22c:

Aside from fixing some crash bugs, the main change this time is the addition of specific pile types.  You can access these from [q] on existing piles or you can set them when you are placing piles by selecting "custom settings".  Piles now make claims on bins and barrels.  This is displayed as "Cedar Bin <#12>".  You can use the [q] view for a pile to set the maximum number of bins and barrels it uses.  For now, a pile will only take one extra empty bin/barrel until something is placed inside, then it will take another until it gets up to the maximum.  We'll add some other options later.  In the [p]ile menu, you can also designate a number of reserved bins and barrels that will be used by jobs such as distillation before any stockpile gets to claim them.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22a:

I fixed a lot of bugs; see the dev list.

The main change for this version was the rewrite of the inventory system.  There will probably be several compat. issues, as well as various horrible bugs.  I've tested and fixed what I've found, but you'll find more.  **Back up your old saves before trying this version**  The old saves will work with this version, but you need to be careful with them.

Those that deserve fingers and toes have them in this version.  You'll also notice right/left gloves.  Creatures lose items now with severs, so you'll lose your left gauntlet if your left arm is removed, for instance.

Creatures are a bit silly about wear they put on rings and other trinkets.  Rings will probably pile up on the right thumb for instance, and earrings will pile up in the right ear.  Armor stands will also only store one glove and one boot for the time being.  This will be sorted out over time.

There aren't any temperature effects despite the residents wearing clothing depending on the average temperature.  This will also be handled later.

Finally, there aren't any gender links to clothing right now, so you might see male dwarves in "dresses" and "skirts".  Keep in mind that men all over the world wear clothing like this, and that's what is meant by these generic terms.  You can remove the items from the entity raw before you play if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.107.21a:

There will be families and guards in new world towns, concluding the first third of the Bustling Town Arc.

There's a wait key in adventure mode now (period), as well as some helpful "are you sure?" prompts.

Various bug fixes -- including the clothing acquirement bug, the shield equipment bug and some ashery bugs.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21c:

I fixed various bugs and implemented other minor changes.  See the changes list for those.  Nobles can still demand items involving small creature bones in old saves, but the preference is no longer generated in new dwarves.

New worlds will see a few cosmetic changes in adventure mode towns (it was not possible to include them in old saves).  It's probably not worth generating a new world for them (and I haven't put up new pregenerated worlds), but the new towns have some larger cookie-cutter buildings like apartment complexes, and everybody will sleep at night and eat three meals a day from a magic barrel in their room that refills at midnight.  Once the caravans and a notion of wealth are in, this can all be differentiated properly instead.  As we progress along the Bustling Town Arc, it'll eventually be worthwhile to regenerate if you play adventure mode, but it's not a big deal right now.  In old worlds, you might notice some things like merchants taking breaks to wander around or sleeping on the beds in the mead hall.  They are just trying their best to follow the new schedules without having a home to go to.

Release notes for 0.21.104.21b:

There's a skeleton of a workshop profile now.  It is in progress and undocumented.  You can select workers to work at the shop either by name or by skill level.  The list is not ordered yet.  You can use the mouse on this screen.  It's also written up in a new way that is independent of the 80x25 window to facilitate some more flexibility later on.

Many small fixes (read the dev log).

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21a:

This fixes a problem with the export feature, lets you play around with the mouse when doing designations and cleans up some of the problems with flows and channel-related spam.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.19c:

Some highlights include fixing the disappearing bone/shell problem and allowing engraved wall images to be toggled on and off.  The detailing jobs shouldn't shut off at random any more.

Some of the issues with cat butchery have been handled.

I did a little bit with consolidating announcments (x2, x3, etc.), but I'll need more time to do it properly.

Alt-tabbing in full screen might work a little better.  Seems to work here is all I can say.

Until I make the cleaners smarter, blood disappears at the beginning of every season now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.19a:

Fixed several crash bugs and cleaned up some affected saves.  I also found out why named creatures were disappearing sometimes and fixed that, though saves in which the problem is currently active will still see some of it.

Chasming refuse is in, though there will probably be some irregularities of which you'll have the pleasure of informing me.

There were some other changes that might help with sheriff/injury tantrums.

Some of the tree designation clearance problems should be gone.

Trade agreements should work properly.

The thieves that enter the fortress are somewhat easier to detect now.

Depending on how you've bound your keys, you should have the odd hold-down behavior only when using a cursor or scrolling now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.102.19a:

Fixed a couple more crashes and various other errors (see the change log).

Genders are mixed on starting animals now and horses should breed.  The unit screen will show some other designations beside "No Job" and there it will distinguish merchants and diplomats.  Water should flow into the cliff face now, at least from new channels.

You can give your units nicknames and profession names now.  Do this from the [vpz] profile using [y] to customize them.  In adventure mode, you do it from the [l]ook + [enter] status view (again [y] to customize).  The [y] command appears onscreen.

Some tantrum issues were fixed.  Placing artifact furniture was actually making them unhappier.  Fist fights and beatings still led to a minor version of the civil war bug.  These issues have been resolved.

The "Shift + R Menu" instead of "n" for the N key has been resolved, though you might need to clean up your old files a bit if you are important old ones.

You can toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode using F11 (or whatever key you bind) whenever you like now.  Let me know what problems come up with this.  I haven't handled direct minimization from fullscreen, but you can toggle and minimize from the windowed mode.  You can also get rid of the "fullscreen?" box that pops up the beginning in "data\init\init.txt" now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19d:

Resolved a unit scrambling issue from active saves in adventure mode.  You will no longer turn into the stray dog in town or a random goblin or warthog.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19c:

Fixed a few more crash problems, but the main thing was to hopefully remove some of the strange mainly adventure mode instability introduced by the last version.  In case this sort of thing persists, please be careful to back up your saves before trying this one.  Worlds that were generated in or even played in the briefly-available 0.21.101.19b are likely to be twisted to pieces, especially if you played adventure mode.


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19b:

Many more crash fixes, including stopping some of those inflate errors.  Those saves are still corrupted though.

I've changed how some of the search routines work.  I tested it out on several saves, but you should keep a copy of yours safe before you try this one just in case, as usual.  If you get around to creating a new world, you'll notice a significant speed increase when the years march up.  Some of this also carries over to the main game.

Finally, aqueduct behavior has been partially repaired.  Building an aqueduct over your chasm should work, but aqueducts over water can randomly drown your fortress.  If you want to get lava over the river, try a stone bridge instead.  If you lava is in a channel next to the bridge, you might need to use a floodgate to get it over.  Bridges over water filled channels probably won't conduct lava properly.  I'll get around to fixing the rest of this in time, but there are still some crash bugs etc. that are higher priority.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19a:

Several crash bugs should be fixed now.  Most saves will be recoverable, unless they have a load inflate error.

Release notes for 0.21.100.19a:

See command_line.txt for information on world generation from command lines.

Release notes for 0.21.95.19c:

Old save farmplots might show "Ft 0/0" for the fertilizer amount.  It will update at the beginning of the season.
